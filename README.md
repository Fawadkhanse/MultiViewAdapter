The project is a MultiView Recycler Adapter with a nested RecyclerView. The adapter is designed to handle multiple view types and includes a nested RecyclerView within one of the view types.

The main features of the project include:

   -> MultiView Recycler Adapter: The adapter supports multiple view types in a single RecyclerView. It uses the ItemModel class to represent different types of items.
  
   -> View Types: The adapter handles two view types, namely VIEW_TYPE_1 and VIEW_TYPE_2. Each view type has its own layout and ViewHolder implementation.

   -> ViewHolderType1: This ViewHolder represents VIEW_TYPE_1. It contains a TextView to display the title of the item.

   -> ViewHolderType2: This ViewHolder represents VIEW_TYPE_2. It contains a nested RecyclerView to display a list of images. Each item in the nested RecyclerView is displayed using the ImageListAdapter.

   -> ImageListAdapter: This adapter is responsible for displaying a list of images in the nested RecyclerView. It uses the ImageListAdapter.ViewHolder to hold the image views.

   -> ItemDiffCallback: This class extends the DiffUtil.ItemCallback and provides the necessary logic to compare items for efficient updates in the RecyclerView.

Overall, the project aims to demonstrate how to implement a MultiView Recycler Adapter with a nested RecyclerView. It showcases the usage of different view types, nested RecyclerViews, and the interaction between the main adapter and the nested adapter.
